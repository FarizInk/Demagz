Electricity is a basic necessity in the community. Everyone would need electricity for their daily needs. Household activities, schools, work offices, public places, etc., all use electricity for their own needs.
There are also many people who waste electricity or so-called wasteful electricity. Small examples of wasteful electricity are excessive use of electricity, turn on lights 24h nonstop, forget to turn off the fan at school, home, or elsewhere, and much more.
The impact of such waste is to cause electricity bills that are very expensive because we use too much electricity and also of course electricity reserves will decrease. To avoid such adverse effects, we must get used to save electricity from now on. And we get used to everything from small things, like turning off lights or fans after school or something else
